The Activities Program provides a wide variety of educational and fun activities for seniors. The Always Active Program helps seniors improve their health through physical activity and education. The Nutrition Program offers congregate meals and home-delivered meals. The Bilingual Case Management Programs supports seniors who face language barriers, or are unable to access needed care to remain in their homes. A case manager can help coordinate their care with appropriate community services.
